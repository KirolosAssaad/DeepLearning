          <p>
            The film industry has been booming since the 'Golden Age of
            Hollywood' in the 1930s. People back then would go to the cinema as
            often as twice a week. Nowadays, there are hundreds of thousands, if
            not millions, of movies to watch from the comfort of your own home.
            The graph below demonstrates the increase in the number of movies
            released in the United States and Canada in the past 20 years. As a
            result of the large movie pool, we are often stuck with watching
            movies that we do not enjoy and the movies end up failing. Most of
            these movies end up costing their producers millions of dollars,
            Disney's "Mars Needs Moms" lost almost $143.4 million.

            In order to prevent viewer dissatisfaction and producers’ financial
            loss, we propose a movie success prediction program. Different
            researchers investigate the success rate of a movie based on budget,
            release time, and participating actors. An important aspect of
            predicting the success of a movie is making sure that its resulting
            revenue is larger than twice its budget. In this manner, producers
            can predict the success of a potential movie before spending their
            money. Viewers can also use this program to check if an
            up-and-coming movie is worth watching.

          <p>
            With the abundance of movies in our modern world, there is a wide
            variety of datasets available. IMDB is one of the most popular
            online databases with information on movies, their cast, crew, etc..
            The IMDB dataset available on Kaggle only contains 1,000 movies and
            does not provide the movie budgets, which is a major feature
            required by our program, hence why we will not be using it. Below is
            a figure of the columns included in the IMDB dataset. The IMDB
            dataset is 309.77 kB.

            Another dataset we found is “The MovieLens Dataset”, it contains
            62,000 movies, however it does not contain our targeted features
            such as the budget and rating. It is instead used in predictors that
            utilize user reviews to predict a movie’s success. The MovieLens
            Dataset contains 6 csv files: genome-scores.csv, genome-tags.csv,
            links.csv, movies.csv, ratings.csv and tags.csv. The MovieLens
            dataset is 1.07 GB.
          </p>

          <p>
            Below we will discuss the model we chose to modify. This model used
            it is own dataset that is collected from Movie Database API (TMDB).
            TMDB consists of 375,377 movies dating from 1884 to 2018. The
            dataset was cleaned and reduced to be suitable for the model used in
            the chosen research. We will be using two datasets. The first being
            the dataset used in the original model, it has 5,000 movies and
            contains the features required by our program. Below is a figure of
            the columns included in this dataset. The first dataset is 477 KB.

            The second dataset we are using is acquired from Kaggle and called
            “The Movies Dataset”. It is a movie dataset with over 45,000 movies
            and is 944 MB, it contains metadata on the movies from the Full
            MovieLens Dataset. The files we are mainly targeting in this dataset
            are movies_metadata.csv and credits.csv. Movies_metadata.cv consists
            of 23 columns, the most fundamental being budget, revenue, genre,
            runtime, and vote_average (rating). Credits.csv includes cast
            information, which is one of the driving factors for the success of
            movies. We believe these two datasets are not enough and we will be
            acquiring larger, more suitable datasets before training our
            program.

          <p>
            This research predicts a movie's success according to the revenues
            of the movie. A movie is considered successful if the revenue is
            twice the budget. The research tries to predict the output value
            using four different algorithms: logistic regression, K-nearest
            neighbors, decision tree, and random forest. Each algorithm uses the
            same predictors and target value. The hyper-parameters are chosen
            based on sklearn’s grid search to find the best accuracy. The grid
            search uses a k-fold cross-validation with k=10.
          </p>

          <p>
            The author of this research accessed the movie database API (TMDB)
            [6] using the library tmdbsimple. This database consists of 375,377
            movies with 16 rows of information. However, 75% of the movies data
            was dropped because they are missing the revenue and the budget
            which is an important feature of the model.

          <p>
            Below are the results of the original model . Logistic regression
            showed the best results of 70.4% accuracy.

          <p>
            We tried to experiement with CNN. However, we faced some errors
            running the model. We had an attempt to write the code for CNN model
            but we figured out that it is not suitable for the problem we want
            to solve and it would probably outputs a lower accuracy.

          <p>
            Ensemble learning is a general approach to machine learning that
            seeks better predictive performance by combining the predictions

            We also attempted to change the learning rate. We got best accuracy
            of random forest with learning rate of 0.0000001. The accuracy is
            73.166%

          <h5 class="mt-5">Update #6: Decision Tree GridSearch</h5>
          <p>
            Since we got appealing results from using Adaboost classifier with
            decision tree. We decided to use GridSearch classfier to get the
            best hyper-parameters. This resulted in a test score of 81.3%.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hyper-parameters = { 'base_estimator__criterion': 'entropy',
            'base_estimator__max_depth': 5, 'base_estimator__max_features':
            None, 'base_estimator__min_samples_split': 9,
            'base_estimator__splitter': 'best', 'learning_rate': 0.1,
            'n_estimators': 2 }
          </p>
          <p>
            This is the highest accuracy we could achieve from all our updates

          <p>
            The best Results we achieved is 81.3% compared to 70.2% of the
            original model. We successful increased the accuracy by around 11.1%
            using Adaboost classfier with grid search and decision tree.

          <p>
            In conclusion, we used the decision tree classifier along with AdaBoost and
            GridSearch and successfully enhanced accuracy from 70.3% to 74.4%.
          </p>
          <p>Our future plans for this project includes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Adapting the model to predict TV show success.</li>
            <li>Finding bigger dataset, incorporate more relevant features.</li>
            <li>extending the model to predict projected revenue.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            This project added to our technical skills. We learned how to train
            and debug a model. We also learned how to save a model using the pickle
            library. We learned how to use GridSearch with different models to
            tune the hyper-parameters. We got introduced to MLPClassifier and learned how to build an ensemble of models like Adaboost.
